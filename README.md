# mythtvutils
A collection of utilities for the wonderful and discontinued MythTV personal DVR, focused around ATSC antenna broadcast television

These are just for me, but they might be useful for others I hope

Instructions for boot strapping:

1) install the latest Ubuntu Desktop
1) sudo apt install git ssh mythtv
1) sudo apt install nvidia-470-driver
1) sudo apt update
1) sudo apt upgrade
1) mythtv-setup
1) It won't let you run that, but adds user to a group. So, sudo shutdown -r now 
1) cd mythtvutils
1) run all scripts ./01<tab> through ./04<tab>
